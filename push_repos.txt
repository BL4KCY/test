Go to a directory
make it a local repo using:
git init
Add the files in your new local repository/stages them for the first commit:
git add .
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:
git commit -m "Commit message lalala"
You need to go to github now and create a remote repos or use github command line.
To do that I think you will need gitsome package in ubuntu, I don't remember search on this.
Copy the remote repo url you will need it for the next step.
Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
Push the changes to your remote repo:
git push origin
